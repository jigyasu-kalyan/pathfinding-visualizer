# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that visualizes the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Users can create custom mazes by drawing walls and then watch the algorithm find the shortest path from a start node to an end node in real-time.
